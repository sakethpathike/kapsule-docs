# kapsule-docs

This documentation site demonstrates [kapsule](https://github.com/sakethpathike/kapsule),
built entirely using it to generate HTML, with server-side rendering powered by a Ktor backend.

You may notice missing topics like modifiers.
If you're familiar with Jetpack Compose, you’ll be comfortable—most modifiers are documented in the code,
and your IDE or a quick search will provide more details.
