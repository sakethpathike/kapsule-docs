# kapsule-docs

This documentation site is for demo purposes of [kapsule](https://github.com/sakethpathike/kapsule), built entirely using it to generate HTML.
You might come across
some style issues on mobile or desktop, or find that certain topics like modifiers haven’t been covered yet.
If you’re here, you’re probably already familiar with how
modifiers work in Jetpack Compose.
If that’s the case, you’re good to go.
I’ve
included comments in the code for most modifiers, so your IDE’s doc preview should help you out.
A quick Google search
works too.

And hey, if you see something missing or think you could explain it better, feel free to jump in and contribute to this
server's code – that way everyone gets the benefit online.
Or, even better, you could add your improvements straight
into the [kapsule code](https://github.com/sakethpathike/kapsule).
Makes it super easy for everyone!
